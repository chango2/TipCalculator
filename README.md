## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

First time encountering PHP in few years after taking a brief lecture for about a week or two.
Thus, I started out with reminding myself all the syntaxes from codeacademy.com and jumped right onto the Pre-work assignment.
Despite being very new to PHP language, my proficiency in other programming languages helped me learn fast.
Hardest challenge for me was the unique style of php coding language that was very different from how I would program with other languages. For example, dealing with $_POST request felt very strange to me, and it took me a while to figure out how to efficiently use POST requests to program. If I programmed this with javascript, I may have finished way faster, but I was enthusiastic about that fact that I am learning PHP because I knew that some day PHP will become important skill to learn due to the fact that most websites still use PHP as their server-side programming language.
